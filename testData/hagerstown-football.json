		"title": "Who are the best Washington County prep football players this century?",
		"intro": "<p>With the 2022 high school football season quickly approaching, it's a great time to remember some of Washington County's best players — 53 of them, to be exact, matching the size of an NFL active roster — over the last 21 years.</p><p>Why only the 21st century, you may ask? There's no question that many of the stars of the 20th century would make an all-time 53-man county roster. For example, Joey Himes, who graduated from Boonsboro in 1971, remains arguably the best wide receiver in county history, and still holds the county career records for catches (148) and receiving touchdowns (42) — he's second in career receiving yards (2,503), trailing the leader by a measly three yards.</p><p>However, I was unable to find reliable statistics for many of the top players from before the turn of the century. I know Phil Petry, a 1963 South Hagerstown graduate, earned All-American honors (according to his county hall of fame bio) while quarterbacking the Rebels to an undefeated season (9-0) in 1962. My guess is he's one of the three best prep QBs in county history. But I don't feel comfortable making those decisions without more complete statistical evidence, for Petry and several others.</p><p>This list of the top county players of this century would not have been possible to create without a pair of websites — the <a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/my.llfiles.com/00300763/Wash-Co-FB-Record-Book-2020-edition1.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"cast-inline-link\">Washington County Football Record Book</a>, compiled by North Hagerstown assistant Dave Foltz, and the <a href=\"https://www.leaguelineup.com/welcome.asp?url=washcofootball\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"cast-inline-link\">Washington County Football League Lineup</a> site.</p><p>In addition, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSenTRaOxPCG05MsZRkJXampDcHLJ8Zo5dnlsVvgUPD0MmeZOw/viewform\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"cast-inline-link\">we are conducting a vote to determine the starting offense and defense</a>.
