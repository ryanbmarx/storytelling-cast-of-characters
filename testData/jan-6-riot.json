			"description": "<p>Tarrio was charged with conspiracy related to the Capitol riot but was not at the Capitol that day. He was the national chairman of the Proud Boys on Jan. 6, 2021 and had been posting comments about the election and potential violence for weeks. For example, on Nov. 16, he posted: &quot;If Biden steals this election, (the Proud Boys) will be political prisoners. We won&#39;t go quietly...I promise.&quot; He shared a Biden post about the virus on Nov. 25, saying &quot;No, YOU need to remember the American people are at war with YOU. No Trump...No peace. No quarter.&quot; By late December, Tarrio and others had organized a new national chapter of the Proud Boys called the Ministry of Self Defense, with members to be &quot;hand selected,&quot; according to court documents. </p><p>The Justice Department alleges Tarrio and others raised money to buy equipment and support travel for the Stop the Steal protest, obtained paramilitary gear, including concealed tactical vests and protective equipment and engaged in messaging and other planning before the protest. Court records also reference a document called &quot;1776 returns,&quot; which laid out plans to &quot;occupy&quot; a few buildings in D.C. including the House and Senate office buildings with &quot;as many people as possible.&quot; By early January, the membership of the &quot;ministry&quot; included 65 members, records show.</p><p>Tarrio was arrested in D.C. on Jan. 4, related to charges involving burning a &quot;Black Lives Matter&quot; banner at a church in December. His arrest prompted a flurry of activity in the group&#39;s messaging activities, with other leaders &quot;nuking&quot; one chat, telling people how to delete all messages, then setting up a new chat, voicing concern that their chat had been compromised. After Tarrio&#39;s release on Jan. 5, he met with Stewart Rhodes, founder and leader of the Oath Keepers, in a D.C. parking garage. Court records state Tarrio then traveled to Maryland, while other leaders in the national chapter carried out the leadership&#39;s objectives. </p>",

Rhodes is charged with 10 others with conspiring to overturn the election of Joe Biden as president. Shortly after the election in November 2020, prosecutors say, Rhodes and others began planning travel to Washington D.C. and training for action there. As the crowd gathered outside the Capitol about 2 p.m. on Jan. 6, federal prosecutors say Rhodes entered the restricted area of the Capitol grounds and directed his followers to meet him at the Capitol. Court records say two groups of Oath Keepers, many in paramilitary clothing bearing Oath Keepers patches and insignia, then formed military-style &quot;stack&quot; formations and invaded the Capitol.</p>",

			"description": "<p>Speed is a petty officer first class in the U.S. Naval Reserves, who has been a software developer for a defense contractor. The FBI identified his presence at the Capitol through a list of unauthorized cell phone numbers detected in the building that day. Speed admitted to an undercover FBI employee that he went into the Capitol on Jan. 6 and made it into the Rotunda, according to charging documents. Of the plan to go to the Capitol, Speed told the employee that he and others planned to listen to the president&#39;s speech then go to the Capitol to protest the certification. In a later meeting, he told the undercover employee that he went with friends who were Proud Boys, and blamed &quot;Antifa&quot; for the broken windows. After learning of Vice President Mike Pence&#39;s actions, Speed told the employee the crowd &quot;went in and we took control,&quot; and he called their actions &quot;impressive.&quot; </p><p>&quot;It should have gotten to the point where Nancy Pelosi should have resigned out of fear for her life. That&#39;s what should have happened,&quot; Speed told the employee, according to court records. In addition to discussing killing Jewish people to &quot;wipe out the opposition&quot; and using violence against members of the Anti-Defamation League, records stated Speed praised the writings of the 1996 Centennial Olympic Park bomber and the Unabomber, saying he was studying their writings to learn from them and &quot;come up with a better game plan.&quot; The Associated Press reported his birth name was Daniel Abraham Speed.</p><p>Prosecutors said Speed went on a buying spree in the months after the riot and spent $50,000 on at least a dozen guns and other items at firearms retailers. During a search of his house, vehicles and storage unit, federal agents seized eight firearms and seven noise suppressors, but did not seize five additional firearms, because they determined those were outside the terms of the search warrant. Additionally they found 25 other firearms belonging to his housemates. In one court filing, the government wrote: &quot;as someone entrusted by our government with a TS//SCO security clearance, Speed should have known better than to engage in his conduct on January 6.&quot; </p>",

The tipster was aware of a selfie Bratjan took in the Capitol and sent to his mother. The tipster told the FBI that Bratjan had been living in Syracuse, New York, but moved to his mother&#39;s home in Minnesota after becoming worried about investigations of rioters, according to charging documents. After identifying Bratjan, the FBI went through previous tips and found three earlier tips about his posts on Facebook and Instagram. However, about a week after the riot, he had deleted all his social accounts. On surveillance video, Bratjan can be seen among a crowd pushing against officers protecting the offices of Senator Mitch McConnell.</p>",

Just after the warning, the agents stated Benjamin Scott Robinson used his body and foot to pound the door. &quot;At the same time, a rioter, later identified in news reports as Ashli Babbitt, was climbing up and through the broken window, and a shot was fired.&quot; At that point, the Robinson family left the building. </p>",

A military and law enforcement veteran, Wilson admitted he agreed to take part in a plan to use force to prevent, hinder and delay the transfer of presidential power, messaging back and forth with Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes and others for weeks after the election. On Nov. 5, 2020, Rhodes urged Wilson and others to reject the presidential election results and said &quot;We aren&#39;t getting through this without a civil war. Too late for that. Prepare your mind, body, spirit.&quot; </p><p>Records show that in a message on Signal on Dec. 30, 2020, Wilson posted, “Things are about to get real . . . and we need to be ready as ever!” On Jan. 5, 2021, he responded to a message about unrest after the next day’s Congressional proceeding, and replied, “That’s why I have all my gear with me.” His &quot;gear&quot; included an AR-15-style rifle, a 9-millimeter pistol, about 200 rounds of ammunition, body armor, a camouflage combat uniform, pepper spray, a walking stick and a pocketknife. On Jan. 6, he left the firearms and ammo in a hotel room, left his pepper spray and large walking stick in a car nearby and carried his pocketknife, but was prepared to retrieve the weapons if necessary, according to a statement of offense. He rode to the Capitol with Rhodes, who had stated that quick reaction force teams were stationed nearby and would be ready and waiting &quot;in case of worst-case scenarios.&quot;</p><p>Wilson entered the Capitol at 2:34 p.m. through the Upper West Terrace Doors, the first of his co-conspirators to breach the building; and remained inside for about 21 minutes. The department stated he threw his cell phone into the ocean in January 2021 to prevent law enforcement from finding any incriminating evidence. The records state Wilson and others continued to plot to oppose the lawful transfer of presidential power by force even after the riot. At the Phoenix Hotel on the night of Jan. 6, Rhodes, in a group with Wilson and others, called an individual on speaker and implored him to tell President Trump to call upon groups like the Oath Keepers to forcibly oppose the transfer of power, but the person denied Rhodes’ request to speak directly to the president. In a Signal message, Rhodes wrote: &quot;Patriots entering their own Capitol to send a message to the traitors is NOTHING compared to what&#39;s coming.&quot;</p>",

I basically organized my own little militia and we (expletive) took over Congress.&quot; He went on to say it was his group &quot;that busted the first gate and kept chasing the cops down and pushing them back into the capital(sic).&quot;  In a Jan. 7 message, he wrote: &quot;Then fought cops all day got pepper sprayed more times than I can count, maced, hit with batons and (expletive) shot and then kept going...&quot; He encouraged a friend to go back with him for the inauguration. &quot;Idk you just gotta come next time. It&#39;s pretty exciting. It&#39;s like the most real version of paintball ever. But with pepper spray, flash bangs and tear gas grenades to throw back at those (expletives). And a huge team of people who all got your back. And will beat the cops off of you if they ever get ahold of you.&quot;</p><p>In another message he wrote: &quot;...there is definitely something satisfying about pepper spraying cops in riot gear and watching them run from you like a (expletive) even though they have face masks, billy clubs and full (expletive) body armor.&quot;</p>",

Denney identified himself as the president and appointed Hazard as the sergeant at arms, saying he was buying him other gear to wear in addition to a helmet and vest. Denney also said they were buying police-grade pepper spray from the Fort Worth police store. </p><p>On Dec. 25, Denney exchanged messages with Hazard saying his trip to the big Jan. 6 rally would be paid for if he wanted to go. He wrote: &quot;Tell your boss you&#39;re going to do your part saving the country from communist(sic).&quot; The FBI reported that Denny worked to raise funds for the trip and recruit others. In one message, the agency reported, Denney wrote: &quot;So Trump has called this himself. For everyone to come. It’s the day the electoral college is supposed to be certified by congress to officially elect Biden. But, Pence is in charge of this and he’s going to throw out all the votes from states that were proved to have fraud. There’s so much more going on behind the scenes though. That’s why he’s called this rally for support. . . . Trump will stay President . . . .That’s why I’ve been super busy. I’m the President of the Patriot Boys in North Texas and have over 200 guys. We are 3%ers. Since I’m retired from the military this is what I do mainly.&quot;</p><p>The FBI reported documenting numerous incidents of Denney fighting police officers, including battling officers with a long metal pole and launching a large tube toward officers. At other points in the melee on the west terrace, Denney is seen in footage carrying a metal baton, forcing a shield against officers and dragging another officer down the stairs.</p>",

In another video, the FBI stated Bilyard was seen receiving a baseball bat from the crowd and handing it to a man who was trying to break a window. </p><p>But then Bilyard used the bat himself to break the window,  encouraging the crowd to enter the Capitol through the window, according to the charging document. The window led to Senate Terrace Room 2 Mezzanine. The FBI stated people who entered the room through the window took items from the room that could be used as weapons, including table legs and lamps and passed them out to people through the broken window. Bilyard was dubbed &quot;#HarvardSweats&quot; by online sleuths helping to identify rioters because he was wearing a Harvard sweatshirt under a black puffy jacket, the charging documents state. Law enforcement officers located an unrelated, previous booking photo of Bilyard from May 2020. </p>",

Beeks, however, was wearing a Michael Jackson &quot;Bad&quot; jacket and a black helmet. He carried a homemade black shield that he told someone on scene was bulletproof. The FBI obtained phone records for Beeks&#39; iPhone 8 and his payments for hotel rooms in Georgia and North Carolina on his way to the Capitol.</p><p>The complaint stated he changed his phone number and the name used on his registration after the Ocala Star Banner and other media outlets reported in February that a group of Florida Oath Keepers had been indicted.

I was shot in the neck with pepper balls and beating in the forearm with a nightstick trying to shield unprotected Civilians from being hit in the head. This was an exercise in the unrestrained addiction to power.&quot; The FBI stated he was seen in podcasts saying he had deposited his guns with another person in Virginia before going into Washington D.C. and retrieved them after the riot. </p><p>The FBI reported that law enforcement agents called Brown on Jan. 6 and 7, but did not discuss why.

But I will never tell who.&quot; </p><p>The FBI located her in surveillance footage inside the Capitol, and matched it to camera footage of her checking out of the Phoenix Park Hotel in Washington that week. When an FBI special agent visited her home on Jan. 18, O&#39;Brien said she didn&#39;t want to talk and ordered the agent to leave. When the agents returned with a warrant on March 30, her husband told them her coat had been hanging in a main floor powder room with her purse, which contained a canister of bear spray/pepper spray. At some point after Jan. 6, the bear spray had discharged, spraying all over the walls of the powder room and ruining the coat, he told the agent.  O&#39;Brien threw the coat away and the husband had repainted the room, however, orange stains remained on the window shade and door jam.</p><p>Records show she belonged to several Facebook groups, including &quot;Stop the Steal 2020,&quot; and had posted multiple inflammatory messages in support of Trump throughout November, December and January. For example on Nov. 25, she posted: &quot;The O&#39;Brien armory is well stocked. Just in case. These idiot&#39;s(sic) don&#39;t even realize how hard it is to buy bullets. They&#39;re gone. We ain&#39;t worried. Lol.&quot;  She also posted that she attended the Dec. 12 rally in D.C. and that she had been walked back to her hotel by the Proud Boys.

Their cell phones showed up on geo-locating software the FBI has often used to place people inside the Capitol building on the 6th. Court records show that Wilson told a court-appointed guardian ad litem in a custody case involving a minor child that she went into the Capitol with Temple, and said she&#39;d been invited onto the steps by an unidentified man whom she assumed to be a Congressman. Afterwards, she stated, a police officer told her and her son that they were allowed to go in. Records show the pair was in the Capitol for at least 17 minutes. Initially, the FBI said, she denied being inside the Capitol but admitted it after the agents showed her photos of her inside the building carrying an American flag. </p>",

In December 2019, he was arrested for shouting during an impeachment hearing in the House Judiciary Committee and charged with disorderly and disruptive conduct on Capitol grounds and obstructing and impeding passage on Capitol grounds. In charging documents, the FBI stated that as of Jan. 6, Shroyer had not completed the 32 hours of community service required by a deferred prosecution agreement he had signed in the previous case. Documents state he had also agreed in that case not to engage in any disorderly or disruptive conduct on Capitol grounds and not to utter any loud, threatening or abusive language or to disrupt any session of Congress. </p><p>On Jan. 6, he led a crowd chanting &quot;1776&quot; as they marched toward the Capitol, then was seen in videos standing next to the inauguration stage and at the top of the stairs on the Capitol&#39;s east side, the FBI reported in the documents. Shroyer was a speaker at a rally the day before, on Jan. 5, stating: &quot;Americans are ready to fight. We&#39;re not exactly sure what that’s going to look like perhaps in a couple of weeks if we can&#39;t stop this certification of the fraudulent election . . . we are the new revolution!

Documents state McAbee is shown on police body-camera footage carrying a baton and swinging at officers while wearing gloves with reinforced metal knuckles. He&#39;s shown grabbing the torso of an officer already on the ground while Clayton Ray Mullins, also of Kentucky, grabbed the officer&#39;s legs in what became a tug-o-war between the two men and other officers trying to prevent further assault. Soon after, McAbee grabbed the same officer and dragged him down the stairs into the crowd as others kicked, stomped and struck him with poles. The footage shows McAbee pinning the officer down for about 25 seconds. Afterward, the officer needed medical attention for a head laceration. </p><p>A tipster turned McAbee in on May. 26, reporting he previously was a deputy in Georgia who had relocated to Tennessee. He was a deputy with the Williamson County Sheriff&#39;s office. After Jan. 6, he deleted his Facebook account. In court documents, the U.S. Attorney&#39;s office stated:  &quot;The fact that McAbee engaged in violent assaults of fellow law enforcement officers while he himself was a sheriff’s deputy and then attempted to use that status to obtain special treatment is powerful evidence of his lack of regard for legal authority.&quot;  The motion arguing for him to be detained also stated: &quot;The defendant was a spoke in the wheel that caused the historic events of January 6, 2021, and he is thus a danger to our society and a threat to the peaceful functioning of our community.&quot;</p>",

			"description": "<p>Thompson was among a crowd of individuals in the melee on the lower west terrace who pushed against and assaulted officers, the U.S. Attorney&#39;s Office stated in a news release. He admitted that he and others yelled obscenities and encouraged the assault. According to his plea, the news release said, Thompson was part of a group that threw objects and stole riot shields so officers could not protect themselves. Thompson saw the police order rioters to stop. Officials said he picked up a metal baton from the floor and swung it overhead and downward against the police line in an attempt to knock a can of pepper spray from an officer&#39;s hand to prevent him from spraying the rioters. After more pepper spray was deployed, Thompson left the area. He was charged with a felony for using a baton against a member of the Metropolitan Police Department. </p>",

			"description": "<p>Pollock was indicted with his sister Olivia and three others who live near him in Lakeland, Florida, but as of December 2021, he had not been apprehended.</p><p>Photos of him were quickly added to the FBI&#39;s most wanted list of Capitol rioters after Jan. 6, and assigned No. 144, federal charging documents show. On March 17, an FBI special agent in Central Florida spoke with a witness who identified 144 as Pollock. The witness stated the Pollock family took &quot;several weeks off of work&quot; in January to travel to Washington D.C. When Pollock returned to work, he showed photos of himself on his phone to coworkers and bragged about being in the news, the witness stated. On the second day after returning to work, Pollock reported &quot;a family emergency,&quot; left his worksite and did not return again, according to the charging documents. A coworker said Pollock&#39;s father answered the door at their home and handed over keys and items belonging to the company and stated he did not know where his son was.</p><p>On the day of the riot, photos show Pollock wearing camouflage clothing, as well as a ballistic plate carrier vest and backpack, also in camouflage print, green knee pads and brown tactical gloves with molded plastic knuckles. At 1:56 p.m., Pollock and an associate charged toward a line of police officers, brandishing flagpoles, the FBI stated in court records. When the metal barrier between the crowd and the officers was pulled away, Pollock charged the police line, jumping over other rioters to attack police officers, the charging documents stated. Pollock grabbed an officer and pulled him down the stairs. And an officer stepping in to assist was also pulled down. Pollock punched another officer in the face and then pushed the officer to the ground by holding the officers neck in a choking action. Later, the documents state, Pollock seized a riot shield and struggled with an officer for it until Pollock took control of the shield, then used it to slam into the police line. The FBI stated that Pollock, his sister and friends continued in other skirmishes up until at least 5 p.m.</p>",

At that March meeting, Duong admitted he was at the Capitol riot wearing all black and two different kinds of masks. The FBI stated his photo was later confirmed on surveillance video. In a March discussion about the arrests of many of the rioters, Duong mentioned the possibility of breaking the people who had been arrested out of prison. &quot;It’s just a matter of figuring out where the prisons are and that should all be public information.&quot;</p><p>Duong acquired an AK47 and a suppressor and repeatedly expressed his willingness to engage in conflict and violence, the FBI stated in the charging documents. He also discussed testing molotov cocktails and talked about their merits. About another conversation, the undercover agent stated: &quot;I believe Duong meant he was willing to barricade himself in his residence in defiance of law enforcement commands and was willing to die in this standoff in a similar manner to the standoff in Waco, Texas with David Koresh.&quot; The charging document listed four unidentified additional associates.</p>",

In an interview with the FBI Neumann admitted to being in Washington D.C. and interacting with law enforcement but declined to elaborate.</p><p>Charging documents point out that Neumann&#39;s LinkedIn profile states he participated in the Ukrainian Orange Revolution in 2004 and 2005, and the orange scarf he wore during the Capitol riot looks like an orange scarf commemorating that revolution.</p>",

McNicoll wore a Trump hat and a replica of the California state flag, on which the words &quot;Trump Country&quot; replaced &quot;California Republic,&quot; draped around her shoulders. Charging documents indicate McNicoll was inside the Capitol for more than 30 minutes, walking around and watching the activity. In an interview, McNicoll told the FBI that she traveled to Washington D.C. to hear the Trump&#39;s speech and listened to all of it before walking with the crowd to the Capitol. The agency said McNicoll had toured the Capitol years earlier and remembered having to set up the visit in advance to get a credential. According to her LinkedIn profile, she&#39;s a Medi-Call program analyst for Los Angeles County. </p>",

The same individual was seen on police body camera footage attempting to grab an officer&#39;s baton and later grabbing a piece of metal fencing holding back the crowd and running away with it. He was later seen in videos inside the building in a room where furniture was being broken and passed outside to others. In some photos he appeared to be carrying scissors and a knife, the complaint says. The FBI identified Morss in these various videos after posting him as Photograph 147 on their most wanted website and receiving a tip. Some tips came in identifying 147 as other people, but the FBI interviewed four people who know Morss personally and concluded that the person pictured was him. They also obtained his Uber account records which showed a ride from Virginia to Washington D.C. on Jan. 6. His credit cards showed activity in Virginia just prior as well. </p>",

She had posted on social media that she was going to D.C., saying &quot;We The People are making a declaration ... 1776!!&quot; She traveled with three other people, staying in a rented condo in Williamsburg, one of the travelers told the FBI in an interview. The witness said they weren&#39;t able to get close to the area where Pres. Donald Trump was speaking so they walked toward the Capitol. The FBI said the witness said they were separated from Southard-Rumsey and then later found her sitting on the steps on the east side of the Capitol building crying and saying she had gone into the building. </p><p>In videos taken inside the Capitol, she is seen entering the rotunda at about 2:26 p.m., about six minutes after members of the House and Senate and Vice President Mike Pence were evacuated, court documents state. She is then shown on video moving through Statuary Hall. Then, the FBI stated, she encountered a Capitol Police officer, &quot;Sgt. N.V.&quot; and began yelling, including the following statements: &quot;Tell Pelosi we are coming for that bitch.&quot; &quot;There&#39;s a hundred thousand of us, what&#39;s it going to be?&quot; &quot;Last friend, last bullet. What&#39;s it going to be.&quot; Charging documents state she then pushed the sergeant, who in an eventual interview with the FBI, identified Southard-Rumsey as one of two main agitators in the group that approached him. The sergeant told the FBI Southard-Rumsey also obtained a flag pole, which she used to push against him to back him up against a set of doors, which opened and he fell into a statue and struck his head on the base.</p><p>In her home state of Florida, she was familiar to an officer in the FBI&#39;s Tampa Field office, after multiple interactions at previous local protests. </p>",

The subject, now identified as Randolph, then continued to assault two other USCP officers by physically pushing, shoving, grabbing and generally resisting the officers, according to court documents.

That account had photos of a man wearing the same toboggan hat who was called Stephen in the captions. Additional photos her Facebook account led officers to a profile for Stephen Chase Randolph.

Although the FBI had received a tip about Roche on Jan. 8, he was identified when the U.S. Marshal&#39;s office and others were trying to find a missing child. They went to the apartment where they believed the child&#39;s family lived and found Roche and an unidentified woman. They told the officers that they were afraid Roche was being arrested because he had been in Washington on Jan. 6. After not finding any warrants for him, the officers left, but they alerted the FBI.</p>",

The photos show a man identified as Quaglin wearing a helmet and a gas mask and attacking members of the Capitol Police and the Metropolitan Police Department. In one case, for example, agents wrote that Quaglin can be seen lunging forward and pushing an officer down. As multiple officers drop their shields and begin to retreat, the FBI stated, Quaglin and others are seen picking up the shields and pushing the officers backward. In another instance, they said, he could be seen on video spraying a chemical irritant at MPD and USCP officers trying to stop rioters from entering the Capitol. Just before 3:07 p.m., according to the affidavit, Quaglin discharged an orange chemical spray directly into the face of an MPD officer who was not wearing a face shield or gas mask. The affidavit also describes a video where Quaglin &quot;can be seen using a stolen shield to push up against law enforcement officers and then hitting that same MPD Officer in the side of the neck and face, as Quaglin and other rioters twist the shield to the side.&quot; The FBI stated he shoved one officer and pushed another by the neck.Quaglin rented six rooms at the Motto Hotel for Jan. 5-7, according to the affidavit, and shared videos discussing his experience at the Capitol during the riot and what he was wearing so other people could find him in the videos. A witness told the FBI that Quaglin, a Trump supporter, was an extremist who had frequently been banned from social media for inflammatory posts online. On Nov. 6, he posted: “Its over”; “I&#39;m fighting if not”; “Like on the streets in dc. Full body armor.” On Dec. 22, he posted a photo of guns hanging on a wall, with what appeared to be a machete and a hatchet, stating: “That&#39;s my basement gun room. I have been planning for this since (expletive) Bush left office and obama came in” He also sent the following message to someone: “I got 3 cans of bear spray” “Huge cans”; “And fas masks”; “Gas”. He sent messages saying he was also taking his guns.The FBI also tracked his Google account history, showing he pulled up the FBI&#39;s &quot;seeking information&quot; for Capitol violence page eight times between Jan. 28 and Jan. 31. He was photo number 58 on that page. Records show he also spent $128 at China Town Liquor near his hotel on Jan. 7.</p>",

That same witness reported Loganbill was &quot;extremely immersed in the paramilitary lifestyle&quot; and felt the Jan. 6 actions were justified. Screenshots in court documents show Loganbill admitted he crawled under scaffolding set up for the inauguration, up the stairs and into the Capitol. Loganbill also posted that he told an officer &quot;we came peacefully this time, it will be different if we have to come again.&quot; He wrote the officer replied that he was on the rioters side and shook Loganbill&#39;s hand. However, the FBI reported that body worn camera footage showed an officer directing Loganbill to leave the area and physically pushing him to leave at one point.In an interview with the FBI, Loganbill told agents he traveled with others to D.C. but would not identify who they were, and that he was accompanied by protesters who were retired military veterans, whom he also declined to identify, the agents stated.

Fanone with the Metropolitan Police Department remembers a man yelling that he was going to take the officer&#39;s gun and kill him with it, the FBI stated in court documents. Video and his vest showed evidence that his badge had been ripped off the vest. But his body worn camera recorded the scene, the FBI reported. That eventually led the agency to Sibick, after a called provided information that Sibick had posted video of the riot on his Instagram account.The video showed Sibick screaming from the lower west terrace: &quot;Just got tear-gassed, but we&#39;re going, baby, we&#39;re going! We&#39;re pushing forward now!&quot; Court documents state the FBI talked with Sibick at least three times, and that he kept changing his story about what happened to Officer Fanone&#39;s badge and radio. First, he said he feared for his life and that of the officer, then he said he remembered the badge &quot;coming off&quot; as he reached to try to help the officer, then he said he dropped the badge, then he said he dropped it in a nearby trash can, then he recanted and said he took the badge home to Buffalo and threw it in a dumpster, court records show. Finally, Sibick called the FBI agent and stated he had buried the badge in his backyard but bought a metal detector to find it and dig it up again, and he stated he had actually thrown away the radio. Sibick posed for a photo with a Capitol Police riot shield, and a screenshot from his Instagram of another photo stated it was the &quot;wildest experience in my life.&quot;</p>",

Video of the Capitol riot shows Khater walking up to his friend George Tanios on the lower west terrace about 2:14 p.m. telling Tanios to &quot;give me that bear shit,&quot; and reaching into Tanios&#39; backpack, according to a criminal complaint accompanying their arrest. While Tanios said &quot;not yet ... it&#39;s still early,&quot; Khater is seen telling Tanios, &quot;They just (expletive) sprayed me,&quot; and holding a white can with a black top, according to the complaint. At approximately 2:20, video shows Khater walk through the crowd to within a few steps of the bike rack barrier and stand directly across a line of law enforcement officers that included Sicknick, Capitol Police officer C. Edwards and Metropolitan Police Officer D. Chapon, who was wearing a body camera, court documents show. At about 2:23, as rioters begin pulling on the bike rack with ropes and their hands, Khater is observed about 5-8 feet away from the officers, with his right arm up high in the air, aiming the spray can in the officer&#39;s direction and moving it from side to side, the documents state. All three officers are then seen on video reacting to something striking them in the face. The officers were immediately temporarily blinded and incapacitated, the FBI stated. Edwards and Chapman stated the substance in the can was as strong as, if not stronger than, any version of pepper spray they had been exposed to during training. A witness identified Khater and Tanios and said they grew up together in New Jersey.</p>",

The FBI also received a 27-second video taken inside a ransacked conference room in the Capitol with broken furniture and televisions ripped off the wall, where Howell was seen leading a chant with about 20 people inside the room. In court documents, a screenshot shows a post by Howell on Facebook, where she said she watched a woman get shot and was tear gassed eight times. In a later post, Howell said: &quot;I have countless photos of bloody patriots, including myself. They shot us, hit us with sticks, tear gassed us, shot us with rubber bullets and knocked us to our feet,&quot; according to a screenshot in the documents. In chats with friends during the riot, Howell was encouraged to leave the building, but she replied, in part, with &quot;No (expletive) way.&quot;Based on an exchange with her father on Facebook about a new cell phone, the FBI concluded that Howell&#39;s father was giving her guidance to ensure incriminating material wasn&#39;t recovered from the phone if it was seized by law enforcement.

In text messages, Norwood bragged that because he dressed in all black like antifa he &quot;got away with things that others were shot or arrested for.&quot; In the messages he indicated that he took an officer&#39;s vest, and included a selfie of him wearing a U.S. Capitol Police tactical vest under a hoodie. Then he texted: &quot;I fought 4 cops, they did nothing. When I put my red hat on, they pepper balled me.&quot; However, when Norwood sat down with an FBI agent for an interview, he said the text messages were meant to make him sound &quot;tough.&quot; Reeder told the FBI that as he entered the Capitol, two Capitol Police officers were waving people inside and one of them told him &quot;I&#39;m on your side,&quot; according to court documents. Norwood told the FBI that he helped protect officers from being assaulted, including forming a human chain to protect certain officers. As he was leaving the building, he recalled, another person picked up a police vest from a stack of equipment and put it on him and then he picked up a helmet before walking away to be reunited with his wife.</p>",

The FBI stated Anderson was in a crowd of people trying to push through a passageway at the lower west terrace door around 2:48 p.m. when &quot;a large cloud of spray&quot; was dispensed. Video footage shows Anderson grab a riot shield from an officer and pass it into the crowd and then helping to pass a second shield into the crowd, according to court documents. Body camera footage then captured exchanges between Anderson and officers. One threatened to spray Anderson unless he released the shield he was using to protect himself. In a second incident, an officer ordered the crowd to back up and told Anderson to stand up, but Anderson responded that he couldn&#39;t go anywhere. The FBI stated the audio captured Anderson saying he had asthma and couldn&#39;t breathe. The FBI indicated the officer told him the officers had to establish a line and then he would call an ambulance. Then an officer brought Anderson through the doors and footage captured him being assisted through a crowd of officers.The Florida Times-Union reported Anderson was fully shackled when led into a courtroom in Jacksonville on Feb. 25. Public records show Anderson is the president of a Florida corporation formed in December called Emergency Meals and Provisions, and has been associated with automotive repair companies and coating distributors.</p>",

For the experience and memory but most of all we can spread the truth about what happened and open the eyes of some of our friends.&quot;Two weeks later, when Morgan-Lloyd, a grandmother, went into the Greene County Sheriff&#39;s office to get a firearms permit, an employee in the office recognized her as a person who had posted on Facebook about the riot at the Capitol. The employee looked around on Facebook and found photos of the two women together and alerted the FBI. Court documents show two other witnesses also had turned the women in. Morgan-Lloyd&#39;s Facebook photos show she had been a Trump supporter since 2016 when she posted a photo of a Trump bumper sticker on a car. The cover photo on her Facebook page is a photo of President Donald Trump walking outside the White House, and, on Jan. 3, she made a Q Anon logo her temporary profile photo.</p>",

Members of the group were seen marching with a larger group of dozens of Proud Boys, including leaders Joseph Biggs and Ethan Nordean, who have also both been arrested.

They were Patriots who were trying to restore the Republic after being attacked by the cops, who struck first. Even those who broke the windows next to the doorway to the Capitol were Patriots trying to find a way to turn the Flanks of the cops.” On another Internet site, the FBI said, Padilla posted the following: &quot;I was right there. I have the wounds to prove it. I pushed the rails, I pushed the stairs, and then pushed the doorway. I was beaten unconscious twice, sprayed more times than I care to count, received strikes from batons that should have been lethal (Multiple temple and carotid strikes) except that God was on my side.”</p>",

The documents also show he said he smoked three &quot;joints&quot; and discovered he had an additional eight, some of which he shared with other rioters.In the video, Alvear Gonzalez explains he has &quot;gnarlier footage on Twitter&quot; and shows the account profile for his Good Lion Films, the FBI stated. That Twitter account posted pro Trump messages before and after the riot, and shared videos during the Capitol riot. At 9:14 p.m. on Jan. 6, the account tweeted: &quot;last tweet. What a day. One last time ... we were livid. We were encouraged. People saw we wanted to get in, and they pushed us further and cheered us on. Glass was broken, offices were barged into, Pelosi&#39;s pen was stolen, Anger was let out with screams. People got hurt.&quot;</p>",

And it’s not complacency, it’s not low standards. It’s ‘this is how it’s going to be, and I don&#39;t give a goddamn,&#39;&quot; according to the FBI.

Crase said he didn&#39;t see any police stopping people from entering, court documents show, and said it didn&#39;t occur to him that he might be breaking the law. He admitted they walked into the Capitol with a group of people and took photos inside the building, the FBI said. The unidentified third man provided records to the FBI showing he was hospitalized and did not join Crase and Williams at Trump&#39;s speech or the Capitol. In an interview with the FBI, Crase stated: “Even though we didn&#39;t participate in violence, I think it was dumb that we went in.”</p>",

The crowd successfully knocked over the barricade, and in the process knocked over a Capitol police officer, whose head hit the stairs behind her and causing her to lose consciousness.Samsel picked the officer up and said to her: &quot;We don&#39;t have to hurt you, why are you standing our way,&quot; the officer recalled to the FBI. She was taken to the west terrace to regroup with other officers for her safety, the FBI stated, but hours later had to be taken to the emergency room after blacking out and collapsing while arresting another rioter. Samsel also is seen in video on the west terrace attempting to pull a riot shield from a uniformed officer, the FBI stated. Court records show Samsel is on parole in Pennsylvania and is wanted on an arrest warrant from Riverside, New Jersey for an alleged assault.  On Aug. 25, Samsel was indicted and remains in custody without bond.</p>",

After the November rally, case records show he messaged an associate that he &quot;was beating commies with a flag polie I picked up,&quot; and &quot;I left one unconscious so I did my little part and got the (expletive) out before I got arrested.&quot; In December he messaged family members and associates about the Jan. 6 rally, including in part: &quot;I&#39;m there for the greatest celebration of all time after Pence leads the Senate flip!! OR IM THERE IF TRUMP TELLS US TO STORM THE (expletive) CAPITAL IMA DO THAT THEN! We don&#39;t want any trouble but they are not going to steal this election that I guarantee bro!!”</p>",

In a social media conversation the day after the riot, Connell said, &quot;4 of us breached the cops blockade and us same 4 breached the Capitol.&quot;</p><p>Connell explained that Adams was his cousin, adding, &quot;When we stormed the cops there was 8 of them and 4 of us so he got clubbed and shot with rubber bullet.
