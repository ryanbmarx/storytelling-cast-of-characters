		"intro": "<p>Not since the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 has the U.S. seen such intense debate over elections and how states conduct them. In the wake of the 2020 election and unfounded claims of voter fraud by former President Donald Trump, many Republican-led states have made election integrity a priority, passing strict new measures on mail-in ballots, voting hours and more. Some of these same states were early adopters of measures to make voting easier, such as early, in-person voting. Meanwhile, many Democratic-led states have worked to make permanent measures introduced during the pandemic to make voting easier and more accessible. They include easy mail-in and early voting and same-day voter registration.</p>",

Alabama passed a voter ID law in 2003 and a lawsuit out of Shelby County, south of Birmingham, led to the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision gutting enforcement of the Voting Rights Act. The state also has maintained strict absentee ballot laws and the legislature has shown no interest in making permanent pandemic-era no-excuse voting. </p>",

			"description": "<p>Black residents and women have had notable gains in early West Virginia history. The state made history with the appointment of the first Black woman to serve in a state legislature in 1928, for instance. More recently, like many other states, West Virginia has seen debate over issues of election integrity, with Republican officials pushing for stricter requirements. The state currently requires a voter ID, a valid excuse to vote absentee and penalizes voter fraud with a sentence of 1 to 10 years. This year, the West Virginia House passed a bill that labels the crime a felony.</p>",

			"name": "Wisconsin",
			"description": "<p>Wisconsin was among the earliest states granting voting access to Black residents and then to women. And because elections are handled at the municipal level, for much of the 20th century, many voters didn’t even need to register to vote. For years, Wisconsin ranked near the top in voter participation. When Republicans took control of the governor’s mansion and legislature in 2010, they pushed through a vote ID law. Meanwhile, ballot boxes became more popular during the COVID-19 pandemic. But scrutiny over the hprocess led the state Supreme Court to ban unstaffed ballot boxes. As a key battleground state, Wisconsin&#39;s voting laws have been under intense national scrutiny since 2020.</p>",

			"description": "<p>Wyoming was at the forefront of granting women the right to vote – all the way back in 1869, a full 20 years before statehood. Wyoming has been steadfast since on women’s suffrage. But at the same time, voting rights have been clouded by nativism and xenophobia. The state had literacy qualifications and federal law didn’t grant Native Americans as a whole U.S. citizenship rights until 1924. Wyoming is also one of just eight states, mostly in the South, never to have ratified the 24th Amendment ending poll taxes. More recently, the state in 2017 restored voting rights for certain felons. After the 2020 election, Republicans in the state pushed through a voter ID law.</p>",
